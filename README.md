# ![icon](assets/1x/icon.png) CardSleeves
CardSleeves is a Balatro mod using Steamodded + Lovely that introduces 15 unique Sleeves, each based on one of the game's decks. Sleeves act as run modifiers, allowing players to mix and match effects from any deck and sleeve â€” effectively playing with the abilities of two decks at once.

# Requirements
- Requires `Steamodded >= 1.0.0~ALPHA-1424a` - [link](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki).
- Requires `Lovely >= 0.6.0` - [link](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector). This should already be installed as part of steamodded's installation process.

# Installation
1. Download the latest stable version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves/releases/latest).
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Place the `CardSleeves` folder directly into your `Mods` directory (make sure it is not nested, i.e. that there is a single folder between the mods folder and the contents).

Alternatively, use `git clone` for the latest development code, which is more up-to-date, but might be unstable.

# Features
Sleeves are run modifiers that are selected at the start of a run, just like decks. Each run can have one deck and one sleeve, and any deck and sleeve can be combined. Some combinations of deck & sleeve also have special effects!

CardSleeves adds 15 Sleeves by default, all of which have a different effect when paired with their corresponding deck:
| **Sleeve**       | **Base effect**                                        | **Unique effect**                                                      |
